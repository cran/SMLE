# SMLE

Sparse Maximal Likelihood Estimator(SMLE)  provides an efficient implementation for the joint feature screening method on high-dimensional generalized linear models. It also conducts a post-screening selection based on a user-specified selection criterion. The algorithm uses iterative hard thresholding along with parallel computing.
